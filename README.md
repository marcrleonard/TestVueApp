# TestVueApp

I've created multiple test Vue apps over the past few years, and I figured I should keep one around so I can remember how it works.

This app uses:
1. VueJS - JS framework
2. Vuex - Global store
3. Vue Routing - for path routing an navigation. 

... This has been derived from the Vue CLI 3 setup. 

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
